			<h1>Hey Softway Solutions!</h1>
			<p>I follow you guys on Twitter and it seems like everyone is becoming zombies, but where is Rick Grimes? =)</p>

		<div class="about_me">
			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a biologist turned web developer.</span> I find great interest and passion when building applications useful for the average person, especially for those who are not into social media.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I do many more things other than develop web apps.</span> I am mechanically inclined and I love working on my car even it isn't broke. I love having the right tools for every job and a dream of mine is to have a fully stocked garage with every tool imaginable. I like watching TV comedies like Modern Family, HIMYM, The Office, New Girl, Raising Hope, Sons of Anarchy, The Following, <span class="highlight_me">The Walking Dead</span> and many more. I don't drink coffee but I like how it smells; marshmallows smell good too! </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a recent Dev Bootcamp graduate.</span> Dev Bootcamp is a short, but long 19 week program, where we were immersed into OOP in Ruby, JS, and HTML/CSS. We gained tools for learning quickly and closely as team members of a family. I know there is more to learn and I'm eager to add more tools to my belt.</p>

		<div class="company_info">
			<h2>The Softway Solution</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">There are increasing demands in software development and you guys offer solutions by working with numerous technologies.</span> Not only do you develop web apps, your company is also capable of developing mobile applications. Your company is continually learning new technologies in addition to staying updated on technologies you have worked with.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">You know when to work and when to have fun.</span> Good companies integrate yoga and arcades as a part of their workspace. Great companies encourage their employees to become zombies! Afterall, happy employees directly correlates to the health of the team and productivity. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I'll admit I don't have an extensive background in software development.</span> However, I am very much committed to this new career of mine and do enjoy learning new things quickly, especially if it makes developing software much easier and showcasing cool app features. Feel free to contact me via the buttons below. In the meantime, I'll leave you with a Walking Dead meme which sort of relates to me =)
