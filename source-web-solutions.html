			<h1>Hey Source Web Solutions</h1>
			<p>So I've learned that you needed a front end developer.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="about_me">
			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a biologist turned web developer.</span> I find great interest and passion when building applications useful for the average person, especially for those who are not into social media.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I do many more things other than develop web apps.</span> I am mechanically inclined and I love working on my car even it isn't broke. I love having the right tools for every job and a dream of mine is to have a fully stocked garage with every tool imaginable. I like watching TV comedies like Modern Family, HIMYM, The Office, New Girl, Raising Hope, Sons of Anarchy, The Following, and many more. I don't drink coffee but I like how it smells; marshmallows smell good too! </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a recent Dev Bootcamp graduate.</span> Dev Bootcamp is a short, but long 19 week program, where we were immersed into OOP in Ruby, JS, and HTML/CSS. We gained tools for learning quickly and closely as team members of a family. I know there is more to learn and I'm eager to add more tools to my belt.</p>

		<div class="company_info">
			<h2>About Source Web Solutions</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">Your main technology is the customer. </span> Although you do specify which technologies you primarily work with, your mission is to learn and adapt to your clients' needs. As new technologies or new demands arise, you learn with the curve and this will help expand your company's tool belt as well as the growth of the company.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">You don't outSOURCE. </span> Too many companies in any industry today outsource to make business. While this is the economical way for that particular business it does not encourage growth of the everyday Americans' economy, i.e. their wallets. Your company utilizes the sources here and now to keep business where it matters. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">Why should Ricky Do be a SOURCE? </span> Well even though, I don't have the number of years in experience as other developers do, I learn quickly (as proven by my Dev Bootcamp experience). I also have experience in full stack development with Ruby on Rails, so where I lack in visually creative skills I make up for in backend development. </p>
