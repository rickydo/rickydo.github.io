					<h1>A Conflict I Experienced</h1>
					<p>Honestly, I cannot remember a conflict I've experienced off the top of my head that would be exciting to read or discuss. But I guess I could talk about conflicts with siblings since those of us who do have siblings know the struggle. My brother and I argue and fight through conflicts as often as the "L" train in Chicago stops (every 9-12 minutes). If it is a serious conflict our actions or words usually make it worse. However, if it is a less serious conflict such as a disagreement on what the main difference between a supercharger and a turbocharger is we usually make a joke or game out of it rather than escalate the situation.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? </li>
						<p>I had one emotional conflict with a parent where I lost trust with the parent. </p>

						<li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
						<p>I won't go into much detail because it is a private matter that has been put behind us but I was basically caught in a lie involving a girl I was seeing at the time.</p>

						<li>How did you handle that conflict?</li>
						<p>I handled the conflict poorly by denying the situation and making up an untrue circumstance. </p>

						<li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</li>
						<p>My actions definitely made it worse</p>

						<li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li> 
						<p>I would definitely not have broken the trust. Trust is one of those things that take a long time to build but can be easily lost in an instant</p>

						<li>What did you learn from this experience?</li>
						<p>I'm too old for those childish games and lies. The situation would have probably played out differently if I just confessed or told the truth in the first place. There is really no need to hurt someone who unconditionally loves you.</p>
