				<h1> My 3 Most Visited Websites </h1>
				<h2><a href="newcelica.org" target="_blank">Newcelica.org</a></h2>
				<p>This is one of my favorite sites because I own a Celica. I do all of the repairs, maintenance, and modifications myself. I have a few other automotive forums which I am a member of but I frequent this one the most because of the quantity and quality of information it provides. I think the most eye catching part of the homepage is the image in the center which is a calendar rotation of members' rides. This image, however, is not the most important part but the link to the forums is. If it was my first time visiting this webpage I would think the homepage is overwhelming with numerous links and other data. I wouldn't say it is streamlined but is is very informative but basic with a few colors. It is more straight to the point than elegant and it has a good amount of "white" space between the divs. The website is simple and easy to navigate if you know where you need or want to go. This automotive forum like many others are for users looking for parts, discussion, and advice in tuning, repairs, and maintenance. It is both serious and silly in addition to having a separate section for trolling. Visually, the site's functions and style is the same throughout any section or link you access. As previously stated, there are a bunch of links that provide navigation to certain topics or areas you may be interested. It is even easier to access information with a built-in google seach for the forums. I feel bored after being on the site for while, well because I'm on it all the time creeping for aftermarket parts members sell but I find the site to be visually pleasing. The site does sell it's own merchandise such as newcelica stickers and shirts but I have not purchased these.

				<p> Hi there I'm Ricky and a novice coder with a will to learn. You couldn't tell by my picture or in real life that I am several years older than I look, oh the gift/curse of being a small asian. Feel free to check out my rants and rambles. </p>
