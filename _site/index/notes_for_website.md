The website is clean and simple. However some people would question why the home page has all the content on the left side. Which raises the question of whether the focus of the blog is on the background tree or on the content on the left. The font color may be a little difficult for some to read. It is a simple layout but may need some formatting to make it more legible and user friendly. 

I think there should be a better section for contact information. Something that pops out and more user friendly. Let's use a better updated picture. 

A list of things to do:

-add contact information through clickable icons
-new profile picture
-maybe use a different font that keeps it legible
-make the home button or link at the bottom of each blog post
-use a new layout where I am in the center: brief intro on my past
	+contact information in a div below
-cultural blogs on the left
-technical blogs on the right
-place wireframe as technical
-place gps as techical
-maybe add an animation to scrolling over links

General template of new layout (subject to change)
