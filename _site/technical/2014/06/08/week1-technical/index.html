  <h1> My 3 Most Visited Websites </h1>
<h2><a href="newcelica.org" target="_blank">Newcelica.org</a></h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite sites because I own a Celica. I do all of the repairs, maintenance, and modifications myself. I have a few other automotive forums which I am a member of but I frequent this one the most because of the quantity and quality of information it provides. I think the most eye catching part of the homepage is the image in the center which is a calendar rotation of members' rides. This image, however, is not the most important part but the link to the forums is. If it was my first time visiting this webpage I would think the homepage is overwhelming with numerous links and other data. I wouldn't say it is streamlined but is is very informative but basic with a few colors. It is more straight to the point than elegant and it has a good amount of "white" space between the divs. The website is simple and easy to navigate if you know where you need or want to go. This automotive forum like many others are for users looking for parts, discussion, and advice in tuning, repairs, and maintenance. It is both serious and silly in addition to having a separate section for trolling. Visually, the site's functions and style is the same throughout any section or link you access. As previously stated, there are a bunch of links that provide navigation to certain topics or areas you may be interested. It is even easier to access information with a built-in google seach for the forums. I feel bored after being on the site for while, well because I'm on it all the time creeping for aftermarket parts members sell but I find the site to be visually pleasing. The site does sell it's own merchandise such as newcelica stickers and shirts but I have not purchased these.</p>

<h2><a href ="netflix.com">Netflix</a></h2>
<img src="/resources/netflix.jpg" width = 60%/>
<p>This has to be my favorite website because the only way TV and movies should be watched is without previews and commercials especially if you have to pay for it! I don't think there is a single area where my eyes would be focused on other than the huge selection of tv shows and movies. Netflix has a visually simple, colorful layout(because of the images). Everything is evenly spaced in scrolling lists. it isn't pretty but it isn't ugly either, a plain layout. Netflix solves the problems of going to redbox, catching up on past tv show seasons, and is a source of entertainment. Netflix content is specific to the user's preferences but also has popular lists. I think sometimes netflix has jokes because sometimes it would prefer a title that I would never watch. The content in this website, like most websites, is fundamental to its success so I understand the simplicity of its visual design. The creators want you to focus on the content not how elegant or creative the website is. It is incredibly simple to find what you are looking for with the search function as well as listing movies by genre and suggestions. It isn't uncommon to be bored with the content of the site because it doesn't have every movie or tv show you want to watch. The website sells itself! If you like it, continue to pay for its monthly service.</p>
				
<h2><a href = "yahoo.com">Yahoo</a></h2>
<p>What don't I use Yahoo for? I use it for the mail service, weather, and basically my only source of news and internet trolls(from article comments). My eyes are always drawn to the news scroll from any distance probably because it is in the top center. The website is well informative, has many navigational links, a search function, in a plain and well spaced layout. It has a few colors, organized, aligned in the center of the browser, simple, and bright white. Yahoo usually has current news and weather and even though some articles are terrible its content remains professional and sometimes newsworthy. Their news video clips on the other hand, are super terrible and try to hard to be funny. Yahoo has it's serious and silly parts but what's life without a little humor? Boring. It is very easy to find what you want because every article has it own link and if you want another topic you just click a different link on the left. I do get bored of the website after skimming for anything newsworthy. Maybe I haven't ventured far enough on the website but I don't think the website sells anything.</p>
