    <h1>What is JS?</h1>

  <p>What is JavaScript and Why Should You Care?</p>

<p>Javascript(JS) is an object oriented computer programming language often found as a part of web browsers which interact with users, control browsers, provide asynchronous communication, and alter content display.</p>

<p>…and?</p>

<p>Well to start off JS is not too difficult to learn. It is a flexible language and widely standardized across common web browsers. Memory management is null because Javascript is plain text which makes compilers unnecessary. The web browser can handle it! Javascript is easy to edit by using programs like Notepad++ or Sublime Text 2.</p>

<p>There are several tools a coder may use in coding Javascript. These tools include Firebug, Web Developer Toolbar, and Node.js Because JS is interpreted by the browser using these tools make it much simpler to edit and test code. Firebug and Web Developer Tool lets coders work on code and test it without saving and/or uploading. You make the changes and debug all from the toolbox in the browser.</p>

<p>JS is a fast and powerful language due to it’s dynamic capabilities. It can handle projects both small and large including doing things behind the scenes or controlling how a web page looks on the screen. However, because of its capabilities JS can be time consuming. This lead to the rise of JS libraries like Jquery and AJAX. </p>

<p>Jquery is a cross-platform JS library made to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It is the code less do more library. Jquery takes the majority of common tasks which would normally take up numerous lines of code replaces them with methods. </p>

<p>AJAX (Asynchronous JS and XML) is responsible for the loading icons when you hit the refresh buttons on the browsers. Without AJAX users would be left with aesthetically displeasing web pages while they load.</p>

<p>JS works well with HTML/DHTML and CSS3. The web is relying more on JS (lightweight and fast) and moving away from Flash (relies on longer load times). JS provides a more user friendly and interactive experience.</p>

<p>JS has its limitations though. It works great on the front end but it still relies on technologies like PHP or .NET which is being solved via Node.js. I mentioned that JS was asynchronous in the beginning and this is where things get more cool. Google Chrome uses the V8 JS runtime engine which handles the role of the server side language as well. What does this mean? Well it means that while a normal server side language has to process everything step by step, JS does not. JS can work on multiple steps at the same time.</p>
