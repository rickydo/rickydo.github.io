			<h1>Hey Astonish!</h1>
			<p>I am Ricky, currently residing in Houston but open to opportunities in Austin.</p>

		<div class="about_me">
			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a biologist turned web developer.</span> I find great interest and passion when building applications useful for the average person, especially for those who are not into social media.</p>
			<p>I do many more things other than develop web apps. I am mechanically inclined and I love working on my car even it isn't broke. I love having the right tools for every job and a dream of mine is to have a fully stocked garage with every tool imaginable. I like watching TV comedies like Modern Family, HIMYM, The Office, New Girl, and many more. I don't drink coffee but I like how it smells; marshmallows smell good too! </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a recent Dev Bootcamp graduate.</span> Dev Bootcamp is a short, but long 19 week program, where we were immersed into OOP in Ruby, JS, and HTML/CSS. We gained tools for learning quickly and closely as team members of a family. I know there is more to learn and I'm eager to add more tools to my belt.</p>

			<h2>A Little About Astonish</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">You build custom applications for your clients.</span> This means you cater to your clients' software needs and demands. This diversity and open-mindedness is great for software companies who want to continually learn and expand. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">Astonish cares about its team health.</span> A happy team is a productive team.  I believe in working with a strong, helpful, and fun team because these are the people you will be learning, working, and living with. You have family and teamwork in your culture and I think that's second to producing awesome results.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I'm not the best or the most proficient programmer yet, but one day soon I hope to Astonish people with my capabilities. </span> Feel free to contact me with the links provided below.</p>
