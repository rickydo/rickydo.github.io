Kitchen Vs Table

DBC sounds like a buttkicker, a mental, emotional, and physical obstacle course. Honestly, it sounds like it would and should be overwhelming but it also sounds like one of those challenges in life where you have to keep pushing, climbing, and put all your effort into it because in the end it will pay off. I am not sure how I would see myself in this type of environment. Sure, I did group projects, presentations, seminars, and even studied in groups but I have usually been the introvert. I am deathly afraid of public speaking. Okay maybe not deathly afraid but I do get real nervous. However I may be, I always get the work done and if DBC can teach me to be a better person, teacher, communicator, and anything else that this experience mya lead to I welcome it as long as it doesn't bite back too hard. I expected DBC to be overwhelming and new. We are literally having an 18 week cram session in what takes months or years at a university or regular academic school. 

I am actually a bit excited to learn in this environment but it also makes me nervous because I am afraid I will have nothing to contribute to peer pairings or to other people. I do not come from a computer science background but rather a biology background and so I don't have the experience nor the coding fluency. Academically I was always at the head of the boat or the middle, but compared to other people in DBC I may be the anchor but I will try my best to pull myself up off the ocean floor for full steam ahead. Even though I am an introvert, I have always asked for help when I needed it and found that I learn much better with other people than by myself.
