Who Doesn't Like App Efficiency?

Innovative technologies usually clash with old ways and methods. There are numerous apps out there which are constantly clashing with set and regulated infrastructure. There are too many to discuss in this blog post but we can go over "Monkey Parking" and "Uber". 
			
"Monkey Parking"

Monkey Parking is mobile app that allows people to auction off their public parking spots. This app allows drivers or people who want to make easy money to sit in hard to get public parking spots and auction it off to buyers for as high as $20. Besides the obvious fact that the government could be losing this money to Monkey Parking, it is also illegal in addition to creating a private market on PUBLIC PARKING SPACES! Imagine not only having to deal with the frustration of not finding a parking spot but now you have to pay money for what used to be free parking. The problem with apps like these is that there aren't existing regulations on these new apps. How can there be regulation on something that was just created. 

"Uber"

Uber is a ride sharing app similar to Lyft and Sidecar which side steps using taxis and public transportation for drivers for hire. There a several problems with these apps in which I won't pretend to understand but I will share what I do understand. Taxi services and public transportation are sufferring losses in revenue to these apps and of course, have pursued legal actions against the apps and even striked. Taxi services have regulations such as possessing accredited licensure to offer ride services; which new apps do not.

Solutions?

Even the app, AirBnB where people could rent rooms and spaces from strangers, may have the 14% hotel tax imposed on them. These apps and many others all have the same problem, no regulation. I'm no lawyer, law school student, or a politician but I do know you are not encouraging innovation by punishing new ideas. Maybe the apps are purposely claiming ignorance but a better way to solve these problems is to make it clear and let it be known what the rules and regulations of these public service apps are before slamming down penalties. Have public forums between government and app owners to see if there is a way to use the apps for everyone's benefit. The market,economy,technology, and demand is always changing due to innovation. Are we going to be stuck using land line phones, snail mail, and VCRs just because we don't have rules and regulations on wireless phones, e-mail, and USB data drives? (just trying to make a point here)
