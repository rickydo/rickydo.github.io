<h1>Mixed Emotions</h1>

<p>DBC was an awesome, maybe one of a kind experience. I pushed through all 4 phases with the mantids, or the improper plural version we used "mantises", and I couldn't have wanted a more closely woven group. We struggled a lot through the phases and accomplished just as much. Each of us came from different backgrounds but contributed our best efforts for each project.</p>


<p>I may be biased but DBC is possibly the best coding bootcamp that exists. At least from what I've heard from other alumni from another coding bootcamp and from my personal experience. DBC has career support and technical coding support not found with other programs, so I'm definitely grateful I put the money towards DBC. </p>

<p>Graduation was a bucket of relief, happiness, pride, and growing sadness. We were all so glad that the sleepless and restless nights came to an end. Final projects were finished and presented without bugs and hiccups. However, at the same time graduating also meant that mantids who came to Chicago were also going to leave, in addition to those of us who were open to moving to different states. When you spend ~80-95% of your waking hours with a group of people everyday for 9 weeks you tend to grow fond of them. They become your family and the thought of leaving them haunts you. I'm hoping the next team I work with is comparable to the mantids.</p>

<p>On the flip side, I'm finally able to play the song "Coming Home" part 2 by Skylar Grey (just her singing though and not the songs with other people in it..blegh). Synchronously with sadness, I'm also excited to drive back to Houston and see family, eat REAL Asian food again, work on my car, and drive my car again. Initially, I hated taking the L train in Chicago but after 4 months, I wouldn't mind taking a train if I had to in another city, especially if I'm avoiding traffic and the terribly impatient drivers in Chicago. </p>

<p>After all the stress thrown at us during DBC it is surprising how creating resumes, using LinkedIn, and using social media apps to find jobs is proving to be much more stressful. Actually, it's a little terrifying now that we are out in the real world looking for careers and employers. I'm not a social media friendly kind of person so tweeting, connecting on LinkedIn, and sending cold emails to strangers is very foreign to me, in addition to interview processes that span longer than 2 hours.</p>

<p>So I'm ending this rant with how I'm most definitely going to miss my new family and wish them all lifelong prosperity and happiness. </p>
