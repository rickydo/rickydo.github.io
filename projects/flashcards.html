<p>This was a very time consuming project that I liked working on. I was able to practice
 more Rails, HTML, CSS(hover effects), pushing to Heroku with a PG DB, using Unicorn instead of Webrick and even a little AJAX. This app was built for my little cousins who are younger than 3. Nothing special, I attempted at building an alogrithm to shuffle the cards
without it pulling the same card more than once before viewing all cards in a set, but I couldn't figure it out utilizing 
sessions. Another problem I'm having with this project is that the CSS is pretty much thrown out the door on the ipad mini even though it is fine on all resolutions on the computer. Even the links when viewed on the ipad don't work. This is kind of a bummer until I learn why the ipad does this because this web app was built with intentions of ipad acessibility. Now I will probably add media queries for android/phones. </p>
