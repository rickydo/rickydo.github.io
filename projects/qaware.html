<p>QAware is a cross-platform application that is changing the way quality assurance and quality control is conducted across many industries. By integrating iBeacon technology with a native iOS app written in Objective-C, QAware ensures that inspections happen when, where, and by whom they are supposed to happen. This was our final project at DBC.</p>

<p>The screenshot below is the manager's dashboard. Both tables are polling every couple seconds so that a manager can see where an employee may be and what and which inspection forms were filled out. Each statistic itself is a link that shows the manager specific information for each location or time.</p>

<p>The screenshot below is the collection of all the digitized completed inspection forms. Each row is a link that shows the entire inspection form. </p>

<p>The last image is the page which holds all of the graphs for each question in the inspection forms. The answers are plotted against time so that managers can see trends and make decisions affecting future efficiencies or cutting future costs. The graphs were contructed using D3.</p>
