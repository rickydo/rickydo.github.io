			<h1>Hey There!</h1>
			<p>I'm Ricky and I've recently entered the tech world.</p>

		<div class="about_me">
			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a biologist turned web developer.</span> I find great interest and passion when building applications useful for the average person, especially for those who are not into social media.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I do many more things other than develop web apps.</span> I am mechanically inclined and I love working on my car even it isn't broke. I love having the right tools for every job and a dream of mine is to have a fully stocked garage with every tool imaginable. I like watching TV comedies like Modern Family, HIMYM, The Office, New Girl, Raising Hope, Sons of Anarchy, The Following, and many more. </p>

		<div class="company_info">
			<h2>Some more info</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a recent Dev Bootcamp graduate.</span> Dev Bootcamp is a short, but long 19 week program, where we were immersed into OOP in Ruby, JS, and HTML/CSS. We gained tools for learning quickly and closely in Agile development. I know there is more to learn and I'm eager to add more tools to my belt.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">What am I looking for in a company? </span> Since I am a little fresh to the development world I would definitely like to work in a company that has a strong mentorship program. A company which works hard in a casual environment but also has fun.</p>
