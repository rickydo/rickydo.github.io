			<h1>Hey LRNGO!</h1>
			<p>So I've learned that you are in search of interns.</p>

		<div class="about_me">
			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a biologist turned web developer.</span> I find great interest and passion when building applications useful for the average person, especially for those who are not into social media.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I do many more things other than develop web apps.</span> I am mechanically inclined and I love working on my car even it isn't broke. I love having the right tools for every job and a dream of mine is to have a fully stocked garage with every tool imaginable. I like watching TV comedies like Modern Family, HIMYM, The Office, New Girl, Raising Hope, Sons of Anarchy, The Following, and many more. I don't drink coffee but I like how it smells; marshmallows smell good too! </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a recent Dev Bootcamp graduate.</span> Dev Bootcamp is a short, but long 19 week program, where we were immersed into OOP in Ruby, JS, and HTML/CSS. We gained tools for learning quickly and closely as team members of a family. I know there is more to learn and I'm eager to add more tools to my belt.</p>

		<div class="company_info">
			<h2>About LRNGO</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">A bartering system for skills. </span> Why has this not been done before? (or at least this is the first time I've seen the idea fleshed out. Trading skills for more skills is an awesome way to learn what you want to learn and reinforce what you know by teaching.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">You are a startup in beta recognized by the press and other big names. </span> People are starting to see the great concept of your company and I want to help be a part of it. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I'm a fast learner. </span> I don't have an in-depth knowledge of PHP, just a beginner's comprehension. However, I have experience with full stack development via RoR, Ajax, Jquery, and HTML. There is always more to learn and I feel like LRNGO would be a great place to start. </p>
