                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This wasn't my first time pairing but it was the first GPS pairing. I like being able to throw ideas and having them either shot down or brought in. If the ideas are shot down then I know why or what not to do. Pairing is sort of fun, well to me at least. I'm nervous during because sometimes I feel like I might not be contributing as much as I should or I contribute too much but it's all a learning process I suppose.</p>
