			<h1>Hey Photojojo!</h1>
			<p>I'm not much of a photographer but I do appreciate awesome nature wallpapers and photos.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="about_me">
			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a biologist turned web developer.</span> I find great interest and passion when building applications useful for the average person, especially for those who are not into social media.</p>
			<p>I do many more things other than develop web apps. I am mechanically inclined and I love working on my car even it isn't broke. I love having the right tools for every job and a dream of mine is to have a fully stocked garage with every tool imaginable. I like watching TV comedies like Modern Family, HIMYM, The Office, New Girl, and many more. I don't drink coffee but I like how it smells; marshmallows smell good too! As previously stated, I'm not a photographer or photograph as a hobby but I won't hesitate to use nature photographs as wallpapers, especially if they are of water or natural landmarks. </p>
			<img src="/resources/water_rose.jpg">
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a recent Dev Bootcamp graduate.</span> Dev Bootcamp is a short, but long 19 week program, where we were immersed into OOP in Ruby, JS, and HTML/CSS. We gained tools for learning quickly and closely as team members of a family. I know there is more to learn and I'm eager to add more tools to my belt.</p>

			<h2>Photojojo</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">You sell awesome photo equipment!</span> I've only skimmed through your store but I can tell these products rock. They are specific to cameras and photography but I understand the uses. Besides, necessity is the key to invention.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">Team dynamics and collaboration is important to you.</span> I completely agree with this "must-have". When we are building things it is absolutely more like play and less like work when one works with a fun and smart team. Some companies have in-house game arcades (we used NERF guns as a stress reliever at Devbootcamp, well my team at least) but you take the team out for workcations which could make a photographer out of anybody =)</p>
			<p>PHP isn't a programming language I know yet, but I am very open to learning it since I've seen it as another popular language. <span class="highlight_me">I'm a fast learner and love learning new ways to write cleaner code.</span> There was an idea I heard from another student which I thought was interesting and would like to work on as well if given the opportunity. His app idea was called "PictureAPoem" which entails a user capable of taking pictures of signs or words out in the world and extracting the words from the pictures and making a poem out of them. </p>
