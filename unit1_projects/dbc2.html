			<h1> How to Change Engine Oil Yourself</h1>
		</div>

		<div id = "content">
			<p>I like to begin my oil changes by first warming the engine up just a bit with a very short drive around the block. This makes the oil warm up and become thinner for a better drain.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>After driving around the block, go ahead and drive upon the wheel ramps if you must and remember to chock those rear wheels!</li>
				<li>Go underneath the car and loosen the oil pan bolt after you have put on gloves and placed the oil drain pan underneath.</li>
				<li>Now remove that bolt completely and allow it to drop into the pan so you can fish it out later or hold on to it and don't let it slip!</li>
				<li>Let the oil drain into the pan, it should drain fast and easy if it's warm enough</li>
				<li>While the oil is draining, go ahead and stretch you back and open up the engine oil cap on the valve cover. (normally says "engine oil" on the cap with oil specifications on it)</li>
				<li>Remove the oil filter with the oil filter removal tool (some oil may spill here)</li>
				<li>If you are at this step, you are halfway through!</li>
				<li>Now that the oil has had time to drain (little to no oil should be dripping from the oil pan now) it is time to put about a table spoon of fresh oil onto the new oil filter. Tighten the new filter where you removed the old oil filter.</li>
				<li>Go back underneath the car and retighten the oil pan drainage bolt. Do not overtighten!</li>
				<li>Start refilling engine oil with the funnel to the owner's manual specifications.</li>
				<li>Pour the used oil into the currently empty oil containers for recycling!</li>
				<li>Turn the car on and let it run for several minutes to get the new oil circulating. Then you can remove the wheel chocks and reverse off the ramps if you were on them.</li>
				<li>Check the engine oil dipstick to ensure you are running the proper volume of oil.</li>
			</ol>
