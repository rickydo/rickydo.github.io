Out of college I was on track to medical school but the MCAT fought me pretty hard and I spent a year as a QA/QC Manager at a Houston beverage bottling company doing all sorts of manual labor and compliance work. It was only in the real world did I realize that the world runs on credit and software. I don't have the credit now but I'm fully capable of learning how to make it by creating software.

Interests:

* working on cars

* watching Mythbusters

* playing various sports
