			<h1>Hey Ken!</h1>
			<p>So I see that you are interested in a RoR Developer</p>
		</div>

		<div class="about_me">
			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a biologist turned web developer.</span> I find great interest and passion when building applications useful for the average person, especially for those who are not into social media.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I do many more things other than develop web apps.</span> I am mechanically inclined and I love working on my car even it isn't broke. I love having the right tools for every job and a dream of mine is to have a fully stocked garage with every tool imaginable. I like watching TV comedies like Modern Family, HIMYM, The Office, New Girl, and many more. I don't drink coffee but I like how it smells; marshmallows smell good too! </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a recent Dev Bootcamp graduate.</span> Dev Bootcamp is a short, but long 19 week program, where we were immersed into OOP in Ruby, JS, and HTML/CSS. We gained tools for learning quickly and closely as team members of a family. I know there is more to learn and I'm eager to add more tools to my belt.</p>

		<div class="company_info">
			<h2>Erdos Miller</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me"> You build the "working" software. </span> In other words you build software that isn't socially based. The working man's software. I would love to build software that isn't concentrated on whether or not a user has superficially connected with another user. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">You integrate your software with hardware. </span> This is pretty awesome. Developing software is a challenge on its own, but integrating software to work with hardware is freaking sweet and even more challenging. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I'll admit I don't have the in depth knowledge of RoR that the more formally experience developers may possess.</span> However, I am passionate about building apps for the everyday working person and would appreciate the opportunity to learn the many ways and projects of doing so. </p>
