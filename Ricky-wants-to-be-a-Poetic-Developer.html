			<h1>Hey Poetic!</h1>
			<p>I don't always drink coffee, but I sure love how intoxicating it smells. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="about_me">
			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a biologist turned web developer.</span> I find great interest and passion when building applications useful for the average person, especially for those who are not into social media.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I do many more things other than develop web apps.</span> I am mechanically inclined and I love working on my car even it isn't broke. I love having the right tools for every job and a dream of mine is to have a fully stocked garage with every tool imaginable. I like watching TV comedies like Modern Family, HIMYM, The Office, New Girl, and many more. I don't drink coffee but I like how it smells; marshmallows smell good too! </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">I am a recent Dev Bootcamp graduate.</span> Dev Bootcamp is a short, but long 19 week program, where we were immersed into OOP in Ruby, JS, and HTML/CSS. We gained tools for learning quickly and closely as team members of a family. I know there is more to learn and I'm eager to add more tools to my belt.</p>

			<h2>A little about Poetic</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">You have a casual work environment.</span> To me this means, you care more about coding and creating awesome apps rather than worrying about who is the best dressed (in regards to formal wear). A casual work environment also encourages personal expression and relaxation for productive poets. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">You are helping make Houston become a tech city as well.</span> Houston isn't a city on America's most popular tech cities, but you and a few other companies are bringing the tech scene up here in Houston and that's pretty awesome. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight_me">Who am I?</span> I'm a fast learner and work well on teams. I've been told that I keep the teams I work with relaxed in a humorous way, but I like to think that a good productive team knows how to work and play hard. I am Ricky Do and I would like to become a Code Poet.
